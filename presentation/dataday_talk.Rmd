# Introduction, why is data privacy important?

---
class: inverse, middle
# Two types of data privacy:
## Disk Sanitization that prevents access: weak erase (deleting files), block
erase (overwrite by external software), normal secure erase (current drives), and
enhanced secure erase (see below). Encrytpion is an example here. Recovery means recovering the data from disk.
## Data sanitization that allows access to data: this presentation will focus on this type of sanitization. You have access to the data but recovery means to identify the original values.

# Why do we need data to be public?
# Benefits of releasing data.
# Public data can help improve public policy.
# It can help improve efficiency of services.
# Can help improve transparency.

# Natural Trade-Off
# Neflix price example: Ratings from Netflix DB were linked to IMBD ratings, where name is public, and some sensitive content movie ratings where released.
