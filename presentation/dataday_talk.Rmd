# Introduction, why is data privacy important?
---
class: inverse, middle
# Two types of data privacy:
## Disk Sanitization that prevents access: weak erase (deleting files), block erase (overwrite by external software), and encrytpion. Recovery means recovering the data from disk.
## Data sanitization that allows access to data: this presentation will focus on this type of sanitization. You have access to the data but recovery means to identify the original values.

# Why do we need data to be public?
# Benefits of releasing data.
# Public data can help improve public policy.
# It can help improve efficiency of services.
# Can help improve transparency.

# Neflix price example: Ratings from Netflix DB were linked to IMBD ratings, where name is public, and some sensitive content movie ratings where released.
